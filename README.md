# 16Ch PWM Power

Giving a user acces to more high power PWM channels is the main goal of this project. The board consists of the [PCA9685PW](https://www.nxp.com/part/PCA9685PW) with some N-Channel MOSFETs on the outputs. This chip has a lot of address pins allowing up to 64 of these boards to be chained together. This board can be used in conjuction with the [Adafruit PWM Servo Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-Library)
